Independent ROV project

This project aims to develop a low-cost remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), capable of underwater exploration and photography. The ROV will run locally on a Raspberry Pi and stream live video and telemetry data over a tether to a topside server. The primary project aims are to learn more about real-time video streaming and hardware control interfaces, and to explore underwater hardware design as it relates to motors and other electronics. 

Initial development: February 2021
Development restarted: March 2023
